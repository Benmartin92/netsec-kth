\begin{abstract}
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a widely used protocol for dynamically distributing Internet (IP) addresses. The protocol is also responsible for the dynamic distribution of the DNS server and gateway addresses. Due its unauthenticated communication, man-in-the-middle attacks can be carried out by rogue DHCP servers providing malicious DNS or gateway addresses. In this report we investigate the state-of-the-art techniques that mitigate DHCP attacks and we propose a new extension of the DHCP protocol that protects against rogue DHCP servers. In addition, we implement this extension using the INET Framework and run simulations in OMNeT++.

\section{Introduction}
%Describe the background for chosen area that is going to be investigated. Write a short description of the area that is going to be %investigated. It is a brief description of the necessary background knowledge of the problem area and for carrying out the project.
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a widely used protocol for dynamically distributing Internet (IP) addresses \cite{dhcprfc}. DHCP works in a client-server architecture where the client (DHCP client) requests an IP address and the server (DHCP server) allocates IPs from the pool of available addresses. The communication between these two entities is unauthenticated which imposes several security issues. Rogue DHCP server can be easily set up that might offer the clients malicious default gateways or DNS servers (see \cite{dhcprfc}, DHCPOFFER message) that can lead to denial-of-service or man-in-the middle attacks. In addition, the lack of authentication allows the attacker to exhaust the pool of available addresses by continuously requesting new IPs using fake MAC addresses and request DHCP operations (e.g. DHCP lease) on behalf of other clients by fabricating DHCP messages with sniffed MAC addresses.
